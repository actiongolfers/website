                        Our charter is to enable nonprofit organizations the ability to reach a larger audience by using golf fundraising as a channel to raise more funds and awareness to their mission, driving a deeper impact. ActionGolfers does this by simplifying, streamlining, and expanding the entire tournament organization process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ActionGolfers will dedicate an account manager in order to help you get setup properly on our app and ensure your tournament is configured to your exact needs.
